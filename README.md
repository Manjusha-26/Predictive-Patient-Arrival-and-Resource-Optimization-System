# Predictive-Patient-Arrival-and-Resource-Optimization-System
## Business Problem Overview

The healthcare facility is looking to forecast **patient arrivals** to better manage resources, optimize staffing, and prepare for fluctuations in demand. By predicting the number of patient visits in advance, the facility can ensure efficient use of resources, avoid over or under-staffing, and improve patient care delivery.

Historical patient data, which may include day of the week, seasonal patterns, and past arrivals, is used to create a time-series model. This model helps predict future patient volumes, allowing the facility to anticipate needs.

## Solution Overview

The provided solution ipynb employs the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The historical patient data is processed to extract relevant features such as date, lagged patient counts (7-day, 14-day lags, etc.), and other potential influencing factors.
   
2. **Feature Engineering**: Lag features are added to the dataset to help the model capture temporal patterns and trends over time.

3. **Modeling**: A machine learning model, likely an XGBoost regressor, is trained to forecast future patient arrivals. This model uses the processed data and engineered features to make predictions.

4. **Forecasting**: The trained model is used to predict future patient visits, and the results are visualized using a Plotly chart. This forecast provides an estimate of future patient demand over a specified period.

5. **Model Saving**: The trained model is saved for future use, allowing the facility to generate updated forecasts without retraining the model each time.

## Conclusion

By leveraging historical data and machine learning, the healthcare facility can make data-driven decisions regarding patient arrival forecasting, ensuring optimal staffing and resource allocation. The forecasting model provides actionable insights that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare service delivery.
